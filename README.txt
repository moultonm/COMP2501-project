DEPENDENCIES:
- standard sfml setup, but MAKE SURE you include "sfml-audio.lib" and
  "sfml-audio-d.lib" now so you don't run into issues with music later!!!!
  
Notes:
- The project directory I zipped and uploaded can be individually downloaded from github if you click on it. It assumes you have your SFML folder saved at "C:\SFML-2.4.1"
- If you already have your own project created, just plop the source code files in there, and put the stuff from "Assets" in a directory called "Assets" in the same directory as your source code (it looks for the textures at that spot)
